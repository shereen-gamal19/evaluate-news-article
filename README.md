The project is that when the user enter any url then the server will get this url and call meaning cloud api  with our api key and when we get the response from the meaning cloud on the server then we it will be object and send to the client so that it will appear on the webpage and if the user enter invaild url then alert message will appear1. i used visual studio code editor then i installed npm in the terminal by writingnpm install2. I install webpack and webpack cli by writing in the terminalnpm i webpack  webpack-cliand then i verified that webpack and webpack-cli are added in the dependencies in the package.json file and inside it i add"scripts":{ "build":"webpack"}3. I verified the dependency for the development in the devDependencies block"devDependencies":{"webpack-dev-server":"^3.11.0"}4.i created a webpack.config.js file in the root of the project and i added the required statements and module.exports codeconst path =require("path")const webpack =require("webpack")module.exports={}5. I typed in the terminal git commit to commit my work6.i added entry point src/index.jsand i added that to module.exports ={entry:'./src/client/index.js'}7. I verified that dist folder is added in the root and insude it there is main.js file8. I installed babel from the commandnpm i -D @babel/core @babel/present-env babel-loaderWe install it so that to translate all of the newer syntax into a syntax that the browser can understand itI created a configuration file called .babelrc in the root and we added this code  { ‘presets’: ['@babel/preset-env'] } and that mean that configuration make babel to run es69.i added in the webpack.config.js  and in webpack.prod.js inside module.exports in the module:{rules :[{              test: '/\.js$/',              exclude: /node_modules/,              loader: "babel-loader"                }]So that we selected all the files that ends with .js extension so that we use regex to isolate the type of file which  we are going to run "babel-loader " on it except the node_modules10. In the client/index js we added a reference to the formHandler function so we call the handleSubmit funationimport { handleSubmit} from './js/formHandler'and we use import because of export handleSubmit that we wrote in the client/js/Submitbutton.js We will find that index.js and formHandler.js inside main.js11.i will change the path of app.use(express.static('src/client')) toapp.use(express.static('dist'))12. I added the index.js file in the html file which is index.html by installing plugin called html-webpack-plugin from the commandnpm i -D html-webpack-pluginand in the webpack.config we add our plugin.And then in the sever/index.js file  we removed the reference of 'path.resolve('src/client/views/index.html) because we don't need it and we added dist/index.html so that express will know the place which the correct version of index.html file inside it    res.sendFile('dist/index.html')And also inside sever/index.js i changed the port to 8081 so it should be different from the port of the client.13. The name of the web.config.js file become web.dev.js file14.when we set the development and production mode we will find that there is a new fill added to the dist folder named main.js.map14. we  will install webpack-dev-serverIn the terminal we will write npm i -D webpack-dev-server and inside package.json we will write in the script"build-dev":"webpack serve  --config webpack.dev.js  --open"And this for running the webpack.dev.js file and open it automaticallyAnd "build-prod":"webpack --config webpack.prod.js" and the two statements for configuration files of production and development modesWe will remove dist by using rm -rf dist command and after each step we write git commit15. we will install clean pluginnpm i -D clean-webpack-pluginand in the webpack.dev to make the clean plugin we will addconst { CleanWebpackPlugin } = require('clean-webpack-plugin');And we will add the plugin to the plugin array16. We will convert all the .css extenstion files to .scss extension17. We will install sass by writing in the terminalnpm install sass-loader@10.0.3And we will add in the webpack.dev.js and in the webpack.prod we will add in the rule array{        test: /\.scss$/,        use: [ 'style-loader', 'css-loader', 'sass-loader' ]}18.To convert all the scss  files to css file by using loadersThe first loader is sass-loader and the second loader is css-loader and the third loader is style-loader and the output will be added in the dist folderAnd to see our styles on the web page we will import all sass files in the client/index.js as dependency19.we will add all the javascript files in the library called Client in the webpack.dev.js and webpack.prod.js filesoutput: {        libraryTarget: 'var',        library: 'Client'    },and inside the index.html i added the Client library to the SubmitButton <input type="submit" name="" value="submit" onclick="             return Client.SubmitButton(event)" onsubmit="return SubmitButton(event)">20 .we will minify the css files  for a better production build by using mini-css-extract-plugin plugin and store it in the variable called ourMiniCssExtractPluginconst ourMiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin');And we will add  and configure it in the plugin array in the webpack.prod.js filenew ourMiniCssExtractPlugin({ filename: '[name].[contenthash].css' }),We will use optimization attribute to optimize main.css in the dist folder and it required 2plugins optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin and terser-webpack-pluginconst ourOptimizeCSSAssetsPlugin = require('optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin');const ourTerserPlugin = require('terser-webpack-plugin');In the module.export we will add optimization attributeoptimization: {  minimizer: [new ourTerserPlugin({}), new ourOptimizeCSSAssetsPlugin({})],  },and in the module we add the following loaders to convert out scss files to css so that  the browser can understand it  but we will update the sass loader because we son't the styles to be inline  {              test: /\.scss$/,            use: [ ourMiniCssExtractPlugin.loader, "css-loader", "sass-loader" ]//we have 3 loaders  ourMiniCssExtractPlugin.loader, "css-loader", "sass-loader"                } We will install the above pluginsnpm i -D mini-css-extract-pluginnpm i -D optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin terser-webpack-pluginnpm run build-prod21.we will add service workers by install workbox-webpack-pluginnpm install workbox-webpack-plugin --save-dev22. we will add and configure workbox-webpack-plugin in the plugin array        new ourWorkboxPlugin.GenerateSW()    ],in the server/index.js file we sis the following:The port of the sever will be 3000to make the fetch requests we will install axiosnpm install axios I install express ,cors , body-parser and i require them in the server/index.js and in the app.get('/',function(req,res)res.sendFile('dist/index.html')to send files to the dist folder I make .env file and put my api key in the variable called my_api_key and i make a post request to get the url from the body and store it int he variable called The_coming_url and my api key and calling the meaning cloud api and we will put it certain formla and store in the variable called The_response_from_api and the response  and we will send the to the client  so that in the client/Submitbutton file we did the following:from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch we make an async function called postthecomingData so that in this function we await to fetch the localhost of the server in the varaible called response ("http://localhost:3000/add-the-user-url") and we conert the coming data to the JSON   and then i did an async function called SubmitButton and in this function I used if statement so that if the user entered a valid url then we will use the post function postthecomingData will view the data that coming from the api to the frontend so that it will appear on the page and if the url is in valid then we will show alert to enter a valid url In this file we export SubmitButton function so that we use it and we import validateUserUrl so that we can use it in the if statmentI put all scss files i.e import them in the client/index.js file and i import and export SubmitButton  functionIn the checkUserURL file i put a function to check if the user's url is valid or not in the form of function called valideteUserUrl from https://gist.github.com/franciskim/41a959f8e3989254ef5d So that in the test folder i make 2 files called 1)testSubmitButton.spec.js (and inside it we test the SubmitButton function is defined or not and we import SubmitButton)2)testUrlFunction.spec.js and inside it we make a test on the validateUserUrl function if it is defined or not and if the url valid and invalid and to fix ReferenceError: regeneratorRuntime is not defined we will import babel-polyfill)and i install jest fot the test unit npm install --save-dev jesti will add the service works to show the content offline by using workbox-webpack-plugin plugin and store it in variable called ourWorkboxPlugin const ourWorkboxPlugin = require('workbox-webpack-plugin');and in the plugin array  new ourWorkboxPlugin.GenerateSW()I opened two terminal the first for development and run npm run build-dev And the second for production npm run build-prod npm startin the index.html file i make a section and i put 5 ids inside it                               id="myAgreement"           id="mySubjectivity"          id="myConfidence"         id="myIrony"          id="myScore_tag"                  <strong>The Results:</strong>                    <div id="myAgreement"></div>          <div id="mySubjectivity"></div>          <div id="myConfidence"></div>          <div id="myIrony"></div>          <div id="myScore_tag"></div>        </section>inside styles file i removed the footer file and i convert all the css files to scss files and i import them in the src/client/index.js file import './styles/resets.scss'import './styles/base.scss'import './styles/form.scss'import './styles/header.scss'and i import and export SubmitButton function
